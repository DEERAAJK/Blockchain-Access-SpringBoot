# Blockchain-Access-SpringBoot

# About 

This is a micro service based architechture with Mongodb with the help of **Spring Boot** using Java for Auditing purpose which uses the concept for Hashing Algorithm (SHA-256). 

## Introduction 

The use of blockchain from the past 5 years has increased exponentially due to
it tamper proof and time stamp auditing method. But the most popular crypto currency uses
public blockchain. This public blockchain data can be accessed and viewed. But for Finance
Auditing this process need to have confidentiality so for that a private blockchain method can
be used where it will have similar blockchain features but with a governed centralized server.
Below points can be consider to improvise on the current version of the project:

• The proposed system will be micro service-based blockchain concept which we
will be implemented along the use of NoSQL for storing the “hash” information.

• At first, the private data will be converted into secured key using SHA encryption
then we will store that data in NoSQL.

• Similarly, private key concept with the help of blockchain can be implemented
using this application.

## Requirements
* Active internet connection
* Fedora 32 or above

## Tools
1. Eclipse IDE (You can choose any IDE)
2. Postman App
3. Java (JDK 1.8+)
4. Maven (3.0+)
5. Robo3t (For MongoDB, Else you can choose any)
6. Mysql 

## Disclaimer
This tool has been tried and tested multiple times and is expected to work flawlessly in Fedora Workstation 32 or above. It has not been tested on any of the spins yet so proceed with caution. While the chances of things going wrong is pretty slim but still you would want to make backups, should things do not go as expected. As always, you are choosing to use this tool at your will and you cannot hold me responsible for any mishap there may occur due to the misuse of this tool.
